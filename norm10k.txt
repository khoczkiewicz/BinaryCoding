 albert of prussia 17 may 1490 20 march 1568 was the last grand master of the teutonic knights who after converting to lutheranism became the first monarch of the duchy of prussia the secularized state that emerged from the former monastic state of the teutonic knights albert was the first european ruler to establish protestantism as the official state religion of his lands he proved instrumental in the political spread of protestantism in its early stage ruling the prussian lands for nearly six decades 15101568 a member of the brandenburg ansbach branch of the house of hohenzollern albert s election as grand master had brought about hopes of a reversal of the declining fortune of the teutonic knights he was a skilled political administrator and leader and did indeed reverse the decline of the teutonic order however albert who was sympathetic to the demands of martin luther rebelled against the catholic church and the holy roman empire by converting the teutonic state into a protestant and hereditary realm the his uncle the king of poland the arrangement was confirmed by the treaty of krakw in 1525 albert pledged a personal oath to the king and in return was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs albert s rule in prussia was fairly prosperous although he had some trouble with the peasantry the confiscation of the lands and treasures of the catholic church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and provide for the expenses of the newly established prussian court he was active in imperial politics joining the league of torgau in 1526 and acted in unison with the protestants in plotting to overthrow emperor charles v after the issue of the augsburg interim in may 1548 albert established schools in every town and founded knigsberg university in 1544 he promoted culture and arts patronising the works of erasmus reinhold and caspar hennenberger albert s final years were clouded by peasant resentment of heavy taxes a step he felt compelled to take due to there no longer being any church land available to confiscate in and paul skali also caused various religious and political disputes albert spent his final years virtually deprived of power and died at tapiau on 20 march 1568 his son albert frederick succeeded him as duke of prussia albert s dissolution of the teutonic state caused the founding of the duchy of prussia paving the way for the rise of the house of hohenzollern he is therefore often seen as the father of the prussian nation and even as indirectly responsible for the unification of germany early life albert was born in ansbach in franconia as the third son of frederick i margrave of brandenburg ansbach his mother was sophia daughter of casimir iv jagiellon grand duke of lithuania and king of poland and his wife elisabeth of austria he was raised for a career in the church and spent some time at the court of hermann iv of hesse elector of cologne who appointed him canon of the cologne cathedral despite being quite religious he was also interested in mathematics and teachings of the church in favour of scientific theories his career was forwarded by the church however and institutions of the catholic clerics supported his early advance turning to a more active life albert accompanied emperor maximilian i to italy in 1508 and after his return spent some time in the kingdom of hungary grand master duke frederick of saxony grand master of the teutonic order died in december 1510 albert was chosen as his successor early in 1511 in the hope that his relationship to his maternal uncle sigismund i the old grand duke of lithuania and king of poland would facilitate a settlement of the disputes over eastern prussia which had been held by the order under polish suzerainty since the second peace of thorn 1466 the new grand master aware of his duties to the empire and to the papacy refused to submit to the crown of poland as war over the order s existence appeared inevitable albert made strenuous efforts to secure allies and carried on by the ravages of members of the order in poland culminated in a war which began in december 1519 and devastated prussia albert was granted a four year truce early in 1521 the dispute was referred to emperor charles v and other princes but as no settlement was reached albert continued his efforts to obtain help in view of a renewal of the war for this purpose he visited the diet of nuremberg in 1522 where he made the acquaintance of the reformer andreas osiander by whose influence albert was won over to protestantism the grand master then journeyed to wittenberg where he was advised by martin luther to abandon the rules of his order to marry and to convert prussia into a hereditary duchy for himself this proposal which was understandably appealing to albert had already been discussed by some of his relatives but it was necessary to proceed cautiously and he assured pope adrian vi that he was anxious to reform the order and punish the knights who had adopted lutheran doctrines luther but in order to facilitate the change made special efforts to spread his teaching among the prussians while albert s brother margrave george of brandenburg ansbach laid the scheme before their uncle sigismund i the old of poland duke in prussia after some delay sigismund assented to the offer with the provision that prussia should be treated as a polish fiefdom and after this arrangement had been confirmed by a treaty concluded at krakw albert pledged a personal oath to sigismund i and was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs on 10 february 1525 the estates of the land then met at knigsberg kaliningrad and took the oath of allegiance to the new duke who used his full powers to promote the doctrines of luther this transition did not however take place without protest summoned before the imperial court of justice albert refused to appear and was proscribed while the order elected a new grand master walter von cronberg who received prussia as a fief at the experiencing the tumult of the reformation the german peasants war and the wars against the ottoman turks they did not enforce the ban on the duke and agitation against him soon died away in imperial politics albert was fairly active joining the league of torgau in 1526 he acted in unison with the protestants and was among the princes who banded and plotted together to overthrow charles v after the issue of the augsburg interim in may 1548 for various reasons however poverty and personal inclination among others he did not take a prominent part in the military operations of this period the early years of albert s rule in prussia were fairly prosperous although he had some trouble with the peasantry the lands and treasures of the church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and for a time to provide for the expenses of the court he did something for the furtherance of learning by establishing schools in every town and by freeing serfs who adopted a scholastic life in 1544 where he appointed his friend andreas osiander to a professorship in 1549 albert also paid for the printing of the astronomical prutenic tables compiled by erasmus reinhold and the first maps of prussia by caspar hennenberger this step was the beginning of the troubles which clouded the closing years of albert s reign osiander s divergence from luther s doctrine of justification by faith involved him in a violent quarrel with philip melanchthon who had adherents in knigsberg and these theological disputes soon created an uproar in the town the duke strenuously supported osiander and the area of the quarrel soon broadened there were no longer church lands available with which to conciliate the nobles the burden of taxation was heavy and albert s rule became unpopular after osiander s death in 1552 albert favoured a preacher named johann funck who with an adventurer named paul skali exercised great influence over him and obtained considerable wealth at public expense the state of turmoil caused by these religious and political disputes was increased by the should that happen to appoint a regent as his only son albert frederick was still a mere youth the duke was forced to consent to a condemnation of the teaching of osiander and the climax came in 1566 when the estates appealed to king sigismund ii augustus of poland albert s cousin who sent a commission to knigsberg skali saved his life by flight but funck was executed the question of the regency was settled and a form of lutheranism was adopted and declared binding on all teachers and preachers virtually deprived of power the duke lived for two more years and died at tapiau on 20 march 1568 cornelis floris de vriendt designed his tomb within knigsberg cathedral albert was a voluminous letter writer and corresponded with many of the leading personages of the time legacy although albert has received relatively little recognition in german history his dissolution of the teutonic state caused the founding of the duchy of prussia which would eventually become arguably the most powerful albert is therefore often seen as the father of the prussian nation and even as indirectly responsible for the unification of germany he was a skilled political administrator and leader and effectively reversed the decline of the teutonic order until he betrayed it by transforming the order s lands into his own duchy secularizing it in the process albert was the first german noble to support luther s ideas and in 1544 founded the university of knigsberg the albertina as a rival to the roman catholic cracow academy it was the second lutheran university in the german states after the university of marburg a relief of albert over the renaissance era portal of knigsberg castle s southern wing was created by andreas hess in 1551 according to plans by christoph rmer another relief by an unknown artist was included in the wall of the albertina s original campus this depiction which showed the duke with his sword over his shoulder was the popular albert
